This repo outlines various scripts to implement or assess the CIS Critical Controls

Blogs that reference or document these scripts are also listed

The Sector 2019 Powerpoint outlines the use of PowerShell to Assess and/or Implement these controls in a Corporate environment.
Many of these scripts take advantage of Active Directory, but they can be easily modified to use IP addresses or ranges instead

In a multi-OS environment, PowerShell can still be used, but OSSEC may be a better fit - the approach remains the same though, no matter what the underlying API calls might be.
